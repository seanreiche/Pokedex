This is a program designed to be used along side any Pokemon play though. It displays the effectiveness of types on a specific Pokemon. Pulls Pokemon information directly from https://pokemondb.net so it will always be as up to date as the website.

Directions:

1. Run getPokemon.sh to generate pokedex.txt

2. Run the Pokedex executable to start the program

In order to update the pokedex (for whatever reason) just rerun getPokemonDB.sh


Notes:

Currently there is a very limited party tracker, initially all of the pokemon are Bulbasaur since the party has to be full for it to work.
